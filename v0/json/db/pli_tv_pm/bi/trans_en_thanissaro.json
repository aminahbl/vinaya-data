Live alone, venerable. The Community recommends isolation for the venerable.’ And should that bhikkhuni, thus admonished, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times by the bhikkhunis she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, it is to be confessed."
